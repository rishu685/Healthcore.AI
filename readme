# ðŸ§  Healthcare.AI

**Healthcare.AI** is a modern, secure, and intelligent healthcare web application designed to enhance the interaction between patients and medical professionals. This system allows patients to easily upload and manage their health records, while enabling hospitals and doctors to securely access medical histories, schedule consultations, and analyze patient data.

The application focuses on providing a seamless, privacy-compliant experience by implementing role-based access controls, encryption, and user consent mechanisms. Doctors can search for patients by medical conditions or demographics, monitor trends in lab results or vital signs, and receive alerts for critical values. Patients, on the other hand, gain full control over their health data and consultation bookings.

Healthcare.AI is built with user-friendly web technologies (Streamlito), integrated APIs for backend communication, and is designed for deployment on cloud platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, making it easily accessible and scalable for real-world testing.

> This project is ideal for healthcare startups, telemedicine platforms, or academic prototypes aiming to modernize patient data interaction and appointment workflows using AI-ready infrastructure.
